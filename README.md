# toby

toby is going to be a midi tracking interface with settings that are all configurable at runtime. The idea is that you could have a variety of YML files describing the MIDI implementation of a controller (produces midi) or a synth (consumes midi). A track could have the MIDI destinations changed. A track could be replaced with a different MIDI instrument seamlessly at runtime.
